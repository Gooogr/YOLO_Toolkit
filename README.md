This toolkit was designed for fast and easy training of YOLO v4 and Tiny YOLO v4 neural networks on the Google Colab GPU, starting from data collection and up to the trained model with custom weights. <br>
In the beginning you only have to specify  the classes from the ImageNetV4 dataset and samples amount. After that, script will automatically  prepare dataset, setting up framework and create most of necessary files<br>.
